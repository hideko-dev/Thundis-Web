# Thundis

**Thundis** is a very fast and cooperative Rest API that allows you to get very detailed information about who is in a particular server.

## Detailed Description
You can use the Discord server that we have prepared in advance and joined.
Also, the API can be used normally if the user you plan to acquire is participating in that Discord server.
It means that the user whose data you want to retrieve should be participating in the Discord server that you specify.
